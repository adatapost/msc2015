 What is "class"?  What do you meant by the term "class"?
 

 The term "class" refer the datatype. The datatypes we've used in different
 programming languages are "classes" or "types" to represent data of different
 kind.

 Why we uses "class" keyword in Java?

 The "class" keyword is used to create a new datatype either from the scratch or
 creating a class or type from existing type (which is known as inheritance).

   
 What we use "classes"?

 In order to solve any kind of problem, we must think & use the datatypes or classes.
 
 In fact, we use datatypes to represent data into memory (RAM).
 

 What is an object?

    Collection of allocated bytes is called an "object".  

 OR

    Partitioned area of memory is called an object.


 In Java, we have two types of datatypes:

    1. Primitive Types  and

    2. Reference Types 


  1. Primitive Types

     Primitive datatypes or classes are not designed as per object-oriented
     programm design and hence they are called "primitive and non-oop"      classes/datatypes.  

     List of primitive types
     ---------------------------
           Name			Size (in bytes)
	   byte			1 
	   short		2
	   int			4
           long			8
	   float		4
           double		8
           char			2
           boolean		1 (Not available)

     So, we have 8 (eight) primitive datatypes and which have non-oop design.

  2. Reference Types 

     These datatypes are created using object-oriented program design approach
     using "class", "interface" and "enum" keywords.

         
     Primitive types are fixed-length (size) datatypes whereas reference types are
     variable length datatypes.

 Memory architecture of Java Program (JVM)
 ===========================================

 When we launch/run the Java program, the JVM's memory manager allocate 1 MB memory
 for local variables, method parameters, return type and method calls and this
 1 MB memory is known as "Stack Frame" memory.

 If we need more memory than 1 MB to store large volume of data, we must tell the
 JVM using "new" keyword that we need more memory. And this memory allocation is
 known as "Heap Frame" memory.


 The size of "Stack frame" is fixed and it is 1 MB whereas the size of "Heap" can be
 vary from 1 byte to 4 GB (or more).


 The "Primitive" types can uses "Stack" as well as "Heap" frame memory whereas
 the "Reference" types always uses "Heap" frame memory.

 Primitive types used as "local variables" and function arguments uses "Stack frame".

 Primitive types used with class, interface and enum (Reference types) always uses
 "Heap frame".


Homework
========

1. Learn java.lang package datatypes

          java.lang.Object
          java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Double, java.lang.Short, java.lang.Boolean etc

2. Access control keywords in Java (e.g public private etc)

3. Java's naming conventions for variables, fields, methods and type name.

4. package mechanism in Java
